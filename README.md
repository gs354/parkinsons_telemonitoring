This project looks at a [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/189/parkinsons+telemonitoring) composed of biomedical voice measurements from 42 people with early-stage Parkinson's disease.
The subjects were recruited to a six-month trial of a telemonitoring device for remote symptom progression monitoring. The recordings were automatically captured in the patient's homes.
Columns in the table contain subject number, subject age, subject gender, time interval from baseline recruitment date, motor UPDRS, total UPDRS, and 16 biomedical voice measures.
Each row corresponds to one of 5,875 voice recording from these individuals. 
The aim is to predict the motor and total UPDRS scores ('motor_UPDRS' and 'total_UPDRS') from the 16 voice measures.
