This project looks at a [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/189/parkinsons+telemonitoring) composed of biomedical voice measurements from 42 people with early-stage Parkinson's disease.
The subjects were recruited to a six-month trial of a telemonitoring device for remote symptom progression monitoring. The recordings were automatically captured in the patient's homes.
Columns in the table contain subject number, subject age, subject gender, time interval from baseline recruitment date, motor UPDRS, total UPDRS, and 16 biomedical voice measures.

As described by Athanasios et al. (2009), tracking Parkinson's disease symptom progression often uses the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), which requires the patient's presence in clinic, and time-consuming physical examinations by trained medical staff. Thus, symptom monitoring is costly and logistically inconvenient for patient and clinical staff alike, also hindering recruitment for future large-scale clinical trials. Hence, fast, accurate, remote replication of UPDRS assessment could play a key part in telemonitoring frameworks that enable large-scale clinical trials into novel PD treatments.
